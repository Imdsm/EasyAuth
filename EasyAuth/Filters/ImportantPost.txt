How to Customize ASP.NET MVC Authentication

If you are developing a web application which requires authentication or security features not included in the 
regular ASP.NET membership feature, you might decide to implement these features yourself. But it seems as if 
the first instinct of many ASP.NET MVC developers is to do this by customizing their Controllers, because they’ve 
decided that AuthorizeAttribute can’t possibly serve their needs. They will decide that the way to do this is to 
write some sort of parent Controller type which examines the currently logged-in user when an action executes and 
changes the result of the action based on who they are. Others will try to re-implement AuthorizeAttribute without 
ever examining the source code for the original.
